# Language App Components

#### Goal

Instead of ever rebuilding a project I want to generate them, this library should help me do that.
Typically the thing that takes up most of my time is creating components over and over. The end goal
of this project is to leave myself concerned with the files, assets and content of any similar apps.

#### Dependencies

For simplicity i'm going to add the eventbus library

`https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus`

Keep in mind Jetpack is out now too. 

`https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx`
